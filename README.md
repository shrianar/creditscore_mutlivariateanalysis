# creditscore_mutlivariateanalysis
This repository investigates how income, savings, spending patterns, and debt shape credit scores and loan default risk. We use regularized regression for feature selection, linear regression for credit score prediction, PCA &amp; factor analysis for structure discovery, and SVM/Random Forest to classify default risk.
